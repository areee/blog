# Welcome to the programming course!
Glad you decided to open the door to a wonderful world of programming! Studying a [Java programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) is a great way to become familiar with programming practices. By mastering its basics, it's easy to continue to other languages like [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and [C# (C Sharp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)).

*"Programming is playing an increasingly important role in today's society and fewer and fewer jobs are completely isolated from the digital world. This is also the case with these websites, smartphones, digital map services and route guides."* (source: [Aalto PRO](https://www.aaltopro.fi/aalto-leaders-insight/2018/miksi-ohjelmointia-pitaa-opetella-ja-miksi-kannattaa-aloittaa-juuri-pythonista), the original in Finnish)

The site is maintained by programming teacher [Arttu Ylhävuori](https://twitter.com/arttuylh). The course material (in English) is mainly [Object-Oriented programming with Java, part I](https://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-1/) by the University of Helsinki.

## Place and time

The contact hours of the course will be in the biology **class 235** except Friday lessons. **On Friday**, there will be online remote lessons (Arttu's live broadcasts from Helsinki). The link to the live broadcast will be announced later in the WhatsApp group.

*Reminder*: You are responsible for reading the study material. You don't have to understand everything at once, and you can always ask questions in the lesson and / or on WhatsApp (Arttu answers them during the lessons below).
